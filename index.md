The OWEL is located at the <span><a href="http://www.vm.nchu.edu.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> National Chung Hsing University</a></span> in Taiwan, led by Dr <span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FO4xM_oAAAAJ&hl=en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kendy Tzu-yun Teng</a></span>.

Through applying **epidemiological methods**, the OWEL aims to improve both **animal and human welfare** (**One Welfare**). Currently, we focus on trying to understand and quantify the negative impact of real life **One Welfare** issues, such as stray and shelter animals issues, inherited diseases in companion dogs and cats, exotic pet welfare, and grief due to pet loss.
