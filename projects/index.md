## Shelter dog Management and Welfare
We are currently looking for grad-students-to-be who are passionate about shelter animal welfare and management to work on this project with us! The project will involve welfare quantification of shelter dog and modelling for optimising the number of dogs in shelters. 

## Companion Animal Epidmeiology and Welfare
We are currently looking for a grad-student-to-be to work on the building a passive survaillence system for diseases and welfare of companion animals!

## Exotic Pet Welfare
With the popularity of exotic pets in Taiwan, the welfare concerns of those animals become more and more obvious. We have embarked to understand the welfare situations of mammal exotic pets in Taiwan and will continute to do so for other exotic animals. 

## Veterinary Ethics
Currently, veterinary ethics is greatly overlooked in Taiwan and many places in the world. We wish to start the conversation on veterinary ethics in Asia to promote the mental and physical health of veterinarians, companion animals and their owners.
